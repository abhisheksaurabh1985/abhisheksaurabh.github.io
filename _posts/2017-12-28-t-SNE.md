## Introduction
Visualization of high dimensional data is a key to problem solving in multiple domains. As an example, in Bioinformatics, cell nuclei which is relevant to breast cancer, is described by approximately 30 variables. Likewise, image analysis or word embeddings in natural language processing typically have thousands of dimensions. Visualization of such a high dimensional space is an active area of research. 

t-SNE is one of the many machine learning algorithms which was invented for visualization of high dimensional data in a lower dimensional space. As is the goal of similar techniques, the aim is to preserve much of the significant structure of the high dimensional data, as possible in the low dimensional map.  

In this notebook, I have left out the mathematical details of the algorithm. The original paper, link to which is shared in the reference above, is lucid enough to understand it in detail. Nevertheless, I'll explain the idea behind the algorithm.
